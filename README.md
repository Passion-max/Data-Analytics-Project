# IBM SkillsBuild Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for the Data Analytics program by IBM through SkillsBuild, designed to showcase my data analytics skills and proficiency in using Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The project analyzes a dataset to extract meaningful insights and patterns.

## Project Description

The project's primary goal is to perform a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb open dataset to understand how Airbnb can improve their services. The analysis covers various aspects such as Points - e.g., price trends, booking patterns, neighborhood analysis. The project culminates in a series of visualizations that aid in the interpretation of the data and support the conclusions drawn.

## Task
- Data Cleaning.
- Data Transformation
- Data Visualization.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and aggregation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations such as line graphs, box plots, etc.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The development environment for executing Python code and analysis.


## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook named `Final_Project_English.ipynb` contains all the code and analysis. To run this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries mentioned above.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your environment and run the cells in sequence.

## Visualizations

The project includes several visualizations that illustrate the data insights:

- **Line Graphs**: Showcasing the trend of room construction over the years.
- **Box Plots**: Demonstrating the distribution of prices in relation to review rates.
- **Scatter Plots**: Exploring the relationship between service fee and room price.
- **Pie Chart** Demostrating the distribution of booked days by neighbourhood group.

## Conclusions

The project demonstrates information such as the neighborhood offering these services, room type, price,avaliabilty, reviews, service fee, cancellation policy and rules to use the house. These insights can assist airbnb in improving its services.
